# PURPOSE
Establishing an agreement on rates or conditions for work is an unequal event. Often, neither party is aware of the acceptable terms for the other party. For instance, I may overvalue my work
and insult a client with a price far outside of their range. I may undervalue my work and do a disservice to myself by underbidding.  A client may propose too low or too high of a rate, either insulting me or grossly
overpaying for the service.

There is an inherent inequality. That is why people accept low pay for their first jobs. It's a reason that companies cannot retain employees. It affects both parties and often leaves a bitter taste in their mouths
long after a rate is (sometimes begrudgingly) agreed upon.  

If I am your only qualified applicant and you need something done yesterday, how much will you pay? If you're paying too much, how quickly will you search for my replacement?
If I need work and you're my only offer, it's likely that I'll take a low rate, but how long will I continue to stay underpaid?

There is a thing in business called first-mover advanatage. It basically means that the first one to market usually has the opportunity to benefit from gaining the lion's share of the market.
A negotiation is more like poker. The first one to show their cards often loses. The purpose here is to help find agreement in the expectations of both parties.
